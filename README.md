wCompass is a MATLAB toolbox for the analysis of EEG signals for neuroscience

A computing platform for processing continuous local field potentials
(LFP) and electroencephalography (EEG). The toolbox, provides several tools for 
signal visualization, statistics, filtering, trial-based and continuous analysis. 

The goal of wCompass is to allow the user to process the data without previous 
requierements of data formating and following processes transparent to previous
pre-processing.
